# CYOA
The game is titled "A Glass of OJ".
The game is about the player themselves in a situation where they wake up after a night of drinking too much and realized your wallet is gone. You have to make choices to retrace your steps and find the last place you think you might have left your wallet.
One of the reasons I chose the "Choose your own Adventure" game option  is because I love video games alot myself, and really enjoy games that allow you to make choices that change or impact the story in some way. If done correctly it makes the player feel like they really impact the world and your experience is unique to you.
